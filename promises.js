//here's another way to handle async javascript, in a way that avoids callback
//hell

//A promise!

//here's what they look like :

var promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	console.log('running some code inside promise');
	resolve();
});

//console.log(promise);

//execute the file to see the output - notice that its just a 
//dang promise object. A promise doesn't do anything until 
//tell it to. Essentially, you run a promise by using the
//"then" method on the promise object
//comment the console log above, and comment out the code below
//to see how you use the then method 

 promise.then(()=>{
 	console.log('running code after promise');
 });
